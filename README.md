# React Conway's Game of Life

This project is an implementation of the Conway's Game of Life with React.

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state. The player can interact with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The Gosper glider gun configuration is already proposed at the beginning
